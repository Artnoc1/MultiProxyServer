MultiProxyServer
=============

A proxy that not only let you run multiple virtual Minecraft servers but can also handle diffrent protocols all of which on one port.
Current supported protocols:
 * Minecraft
 * IRC (unencrypted)
 * HTTP
 * HTTPS*
 
*note: without client authentication works, I haven't tested the other ones.
You will need to add the correct certificates.
